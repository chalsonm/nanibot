# This script derived from Adafruit BNO055 WebGL Example

# Requires the flask web framework to be installed.  See http://flask.pocoo.org/
# for installation instructions, however on a Linux machine like the Raspberry
# Pi or BeagleBone black you can likely install it by running:
#  sudo apt-get update
#  sudo apt-get install python-pip
#  sudo pip install flask
